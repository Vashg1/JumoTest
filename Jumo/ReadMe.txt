The programming language I picked it C# 
I used Visual Studio 2010 with windows forms components. I went with this selection because I am comfortable with these tools and use them in my day to day operations.
The front is just  basic page with a button to process. Nothing fancy. Nothing extra. 
I used hash table for this, to help me identify the key and for Lookup efficiency
I did cater for if the columns were to change position

Assumptions 
Loans.csv Is stored in c:/temp
If there is no file available, it will  display a message 
This application could have catered for a few error handling. But I wanted to keep the project clean, simple and keep to the basic requirements  
Column names always stay the same

Some of the error handling to think of :
•	More fields sent than required
•	Invalid Characters
•	Missing values and fields
